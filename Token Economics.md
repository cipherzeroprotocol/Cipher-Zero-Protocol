# Token Economics: CipherZeroToken (CZT)

## 1. Overview

The CipherZeroToken (CZT) is the native utility token of the Cipher Zero Protocol. It plays a crucial role in the ecosystem, facilitating transactions, incentivizing network participants, and governing the protocol.

## 2. Token Utility

CZT serves multiple purposes within the Cipher Zero ecosystem:

### 2.1 Transaction Fees
- Users pay network fees in CZT for file uploads, downloads, and data transfers.
- A portion of these fees is burned, creating deflationary pressure.

### 2.2 Staking
- Node operators stake CZT to participate in network validation and earn rewards.
- Users can stake CZT to access premium features or higher bandwidth.

### 2.3 Governance
- CZT holders can vote on protocol upgrades and parameter changes.
- The weight of votes is proportional to the amount of CZT staked.

### 2.4 Incentives
- Rewards for file hosting and sharing are distributed in CZT.
- Bug bounties and development grants are paid out in CZT.

### 2.5 Cross-chain Operations
- CZT is used to pay for cross-chain transfer fees when using the Wormhole integration.

    5. Economic Model
5.1 Token Issuance

Initial supply: 1,000,000,000 CZT
No additional tokens will be minted (fixed supply)

5.2 Deflationary Mechanisms

30% of transaction fees are burned
Quarterly token buyback and burn using 10% of protocol revenue

5.3 Staking Rewards

Annual percentage yield (APY) for staking starts at 12%
APY adjusts dynamically based on the total amount staked to maintain network security

7. Governance

Proposal Threshold: 100,000 CZT
Quorum Requirement: 10% of circulating supply
Voting Period: 7 days
Time Lock: 2 days for implementation after a successful vote

8. Economic Security Measures
8.1 Slashing Conditions

Node operators can have their stake slashed for malicious behavior
Slashing rates range from 1% to 100% depending on the severity of the offense

8.2 Liquidity Provisions

5% of the Ecosystem Fund is allocated to provide liquidity on decentralized exchanges

8.3 Oracle Usage

Chainlink oracles are used to determine the CZT/USD price for fee calculations

9. Cross-chain Considerations

Wrapped versions of CZT (wCZT) are available on supported blockchains
1:1 backing ensured through Wormhole integration
Cross-chain transfers incur a 0.1% fee, split between Cipher Zero Protocol and Wormhole

10. Future Economic Adjustments

The Cipher Zero DAO can propose and vote on changes to the token economics
Any changes to the total supply or major economic parameters require a super-majority (75%) vote

By implementing this comprehensive token economic model, CipherZeroToken (CZT) aims to create a sustainable, deflationary, and utility-driven ecosystem that aligns the interests of all participants in the Cipher Zero Protocol.

This token economics section provides a detailed overview of the CipherZeroToken (CZT), covering its utility, distribution, vesting schedule, economic model, governance, and security measures. The use of tables, charts, and diagrams helps to visualize complex information, making it easier for readers to understand the token's role and value in the Cipher Zero ecosystem.

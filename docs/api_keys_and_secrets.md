API Keys and Secrets for BitTheta Secure
Introduction
Certain functionalities within the BitTheta Secure project require API keys and secret keys provided by external services. This document outlines the importance of these keys and the implications of their absence.

1. Naoris Protocol
API Keys and Secrets
Required: API keys and secret keys are necessary for interacting with Naoris Protocol nodes and accessing advanced security features.
Implication: Without these keys, integration with Naoris Protocol cannot be established, and security features will not function.
2. Alvara Protocol
API Keys and Secrets
Required: API keys and secret keys are needed for managing decentralized investment funds and interacting with Alvara DAO.
Implication: Lack of these keys will prevent the deployment and interaction with Alvara Protocol's smart contracts and DAO governance.
3. Theta Blockchain
API Keys and Secrets
Required: API keys and secret keys are essential for interacting with Theta Blockchain's decentralized content delivery and streaming services.
Implication: Without these keys, smart contracts and blockchain interactions with Theta Blockchain will not be operational.
Conclusion
To fully utilize the features and functionalities provided by Naoris Protocol, Alvara Protocol, and Theta Blockchain, it is crucial to obtain the necessary API keys and secret keys. The absence of these keys will limit the project's capabilities and prevent successful integration with these services.
